#### Education

Ph.D., Duke University, 2011\
B.S., B.A., University of Notre Dame, 2005

#### Profile

I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Boston College, where I've been since 2016. I direct the Memory Modulation Lab, where we use the tools of cognitive neuroscience to investigate the neural bases of episodic memory. I’m especially interested in the brain network connections that mediate the encoding and retrieval of event memories, and how these processes are modulated by the contents and precision of memories, their emotional significance, and other contextual factors. My research has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. At Boston College, I teach [courses](http://www.thememolab.org/pages/courses) related to cognitive neuroscience, research methods, and, of course, memory and the hippocampus.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, hiking, adventures in baking, and Boston summers.
