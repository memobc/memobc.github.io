#### Profile

I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. I direct the MemoLab, where we investigate the cognitive and neural processes supporting episodic memory. I am particularly interested in the brain processes involved in reconstructing event details, their relation to memory specificity, and their modulation by social, emotional, and attentional factors. I received my Ph.D. in Psychology and Neuroscience from Duke University, followed by postdoctoral training at the University of California, Davis. Before joining UCLA, I was on the faculty at Boston College for several years. My lab's research has been supported by a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation and grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading (mostly fiction), hiking, and adventures in baking.
