#### Education

I completed both my undergraduate and master’s degrees in German Department. During my master’s, I began exploring the intersection of linguistics and psychology, specifically psycholinguistics. My master’s thesis investigated whether adult native Chinese speakers learning German as a second language exhibit underspecification in acquiring the strong adjective declension rules in German, meaning whether they store explicitly learned grammatical items as more abstract and simplified items in their mental lexicon.

Simultaneously during my master’s, I conducted research in cognitive neuroscience, specifically focusing on visual mental imagery.

I hope to integrate my interests in linguistics and visual memory representation by conducting research on the interaction between different types of memory representations during my PhD at the MemoLab.

Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and traveling.
