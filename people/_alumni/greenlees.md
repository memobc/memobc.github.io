I am conducting an honors senior thesis project investigating the role of low-level perceptual detail, like luminance and saturation, on episodic memory vividness. On a broader note, my research interests lie in consciousness & cognitive neuroscience, and I have a particular interest in neurodegenerative disorders. I love being a part of the MemoLab and look forward to learning, branching out, and taking the lead on my own project this year!

Outside of lab, I enjoy spending my time reading anything under the sun, listening to music & co-hosting a radio show, and hiking.
