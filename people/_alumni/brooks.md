I am very excited to have joined the Memory Modulation Lab in 2019 as a Visiting Scholar! I am coming from Princeton University, where I am a neuroscience graduate student in the [Princeton Computational Memory Lab](http://compmem.princeton.edu/) with Prof. Ken Norman. I received an A.B. in Psychology with a minor in Neuroscience from Princeton in 2015, after which I worked in the Computational Memory Lab for two years as a research assistant/lab manager. I have been pursuing various interests which include (sleep-dependent) memory consolidation and competition, cognitive neuroscience, and psychiatry. I look forward to continuing my research, especially in regards to memory reactivation and emotional memory regulation, at Boston College.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my husband, dabbling with art, reading good mystery books, and baking yummy desserts for other people to consume!
