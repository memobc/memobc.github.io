I am a Co-op student at Northeastern University, graduating in 2025 with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and a minor in Information and Graphic Design. I look forward to exploring the brain connectivity involved in episodic memories with the MemoLab.

Outside the lab, I enjoy racing in triathlons, baking, and photography.
