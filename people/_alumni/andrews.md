I am completing an honors thesis project on the relationship between theory of mind and the reconstruction of episodic memories. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work at the Memory Modulation Lab and am looking forward to completing my research this upcoming year.

Outside of the lab, I love hiking, singing, photography, and hunting for seaglass.
