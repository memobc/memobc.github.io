I graduated from Cornell University in 2014 with a degree in Human Development and a concentration in Developmental Behavioral Neuroscience and spent the last two years working as the laboratory manager for the [Cognitive Aging and Neuroimaging Lab](http://canlab.la.psu.edu/) at Penn State University. During my time at Penn State, my research focused on the study of neural architecture underlying false memory. I am excited to join the Memory Modulation Lab in Boston College, where I will look to continue my work studying the cognitive neuroscience of memory.

Outside of the lab I love to ski (fast), play soccer, run, workout, read a good book, and I am an avid soccer and football fan.
