#### Education

B.S., Neuroscience, Westminster College, 2024

#### Profile

I completed my B.S. in Neuroscience and my B.A. in Modern Language in May of 2024 where I completed an honors thesis examining the late positive potential as a marker of emotional memory consolidation. I am splitting my time between the CANLab and the MEMOLab and I am excited to continue building on my experiences and learning more outside of it!

When I am not in lab I enjoy painting and biking and enjoying live music.
