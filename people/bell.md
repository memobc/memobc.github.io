#### Education

B.S., Neuroscience, Boston College, 2026

#### Profile

I am a current senior at Boston College studying Neuroscience on the Pre-Medical track. For my honors thesis, I plan to examine how sleep contributes to the sequential structure of memory and promotes the semanticization of educational content using natural language processing tools. Outside of the lab, I volunteer at Franciscan Childrenâ€™s Hospital and am the vice president of the Cooking Club of Boston College. I am excited to be back in the MEMO Lab this year!
