#### Education

B.S., Neuroscience, Boston College, 2026

#### Profile

I’m studying Neuroscience at Boston College on the pre-medical track with a minor in Global Public Health. For my honors thesis, I’m investigating how the intersection of the testing effect and the levels-of-processing framework influences memory specificity. I’m excited to pursue these topics this year in the MemoLab!

Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and playing the flute in various ensembles on campus.
