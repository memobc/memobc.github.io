#### Profile

I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from Boston College in May 2025, under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth A. Kensinger. My doctoral research examined the causal role of the left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in emotional episodic memory encoding in young adults, using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). In parallel, I investigated the neural correlates of lateral PFC engagement during emotional memory retrieval in both younger and older adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

I am eager to continue leveraging neuroscience methods—including rTMS and fMRI—to explore the contributions of other cortical regions, such as the angular gyrus, to episodic memory processes. I am particularly interested in integrating emotional processing into future research that examines the role of posterior brain regions in emotional episodic memory retrieval.

Outside the lab, I enjoy long walks, good coffee, and spending time with my partner and our cats.
