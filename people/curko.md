#### Education

B.S., Lafayette College, 2022

#### Profile

I graduated from Lafayette College in 2022 with a B.S. in Psychology and a minor in Mathematics. There, I completed an honors thesis examining the role of contextual information in passage comprehension and recall. I look forward to pursuing my interests in episodic memory and emotion in the MemoLab!

Outside of the lab, I love playing volleyball, discovering new music, reading, and traveling.
