The MemoLab will be moving to [UCLA Psychology](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/) in January 2026. As memory researchers, we know that the past becomes a part of us, and I'm fortunate to now carry a decade of wonderful memories from Boston College. At the same time, I'm excited for the chance to build something new at UCLA. I'll be [recruiting grad students](/gradapps) in the upcoming cycle, and we're also welcoming applications for a [co-mentored postdoc position](/news/2025-09-15-postdoc-2025.html) as well.
