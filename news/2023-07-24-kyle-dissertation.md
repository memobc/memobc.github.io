Congratulations to Dr. Kyle Kurkela, who successfully defended his dissertation today! His dissertation was entitled, *The relationship between brain network organization and variability in episodic memory outcomes and abilities*. Kyle has been in the lab for as long as the lab has existed, starting first as a research assistant and then as a PhD student. He has a remarkable ability to translate complex statistical concepts into something anyone can understand, usually with a sports analogy or two-- a skill that was on display during his excellent dissertation talk. Congrats again!
