This summer, we welcomed [Dr. Sandry Garcia](/people/garcia.html) as a new postdoc in the MemoLab! Sandry recently graduated from BC, where her PhD was focused on prefrontal contributions to emotional memory across the lifespan. In the MemoLab, she will be leading our TMS-FMRI project to investigate the role of the angular gyrus and connected brain areas in supporting memory precision. Welcome Sandry!

To celebrate the summer, we played tourists in our own city and went on a Boston Duck Tour!
