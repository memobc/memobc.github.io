Interested in individual differences in memory networks? Check out our new [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.31.555768v1) on *bioRxiv*, "Intrinsic functional connectivity among memory networks does not predict individual differences in narrative recall." This project was led by recent grad Dr. Kyle Kurkela, who analyzed fMRI data from 243 individuals from the Cam-CAN dataset. As signaled by the title, we found little-to-no evidence for a relationship between individual differences in memory ability and the strength of default network connections commonly associated with memory function. Surprised? Read the paper to find out more - and see our thoughts on what this means for future research.
