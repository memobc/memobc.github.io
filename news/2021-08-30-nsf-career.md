It's really happening! The lab is now funded by an NSF CAREER award, *Cognitive and neural factors shaping the multidimensional quality of episodic memory*. We are going to study the brain network patterns that predict what people remember about events. You can read more about the project [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2047415).

A big thank you to everyone who has played a role in shaping the ideas and methods that we have planned, especially the MemoLab members past and present.
