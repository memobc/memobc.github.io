    "text": "PSYC3371 - Cognitive Neuroscience\nHave you ever wondered where your memories are stored? Or how we perceive a rich visual world based on simple changes in light? Or what is going on in your brain when you’re distracted during class? Cognitive neuroscience aims to reveal the connections between mind and brain, linking cognitive phenomena to neurobiological processes. This course will introduce the neural bases of perception, attention, memory, emotion, and other cognitive functions, as well as the key research methods used to investigate these topics (functional MRI, EEG, lesion studies, neurostimulation). The course will also encourage critical evaluation of the scientific evidence presented in primary research articles in cognitive neuroscience. Class periods will include instructor-led lectures as well as team-led discussions of primary research articles.\n\n\n\nPSYC4425 - Programming for Psychology and Neuroscience\nThis course will provide an introduction to computer programming and its applications to psychology and neuroscience. The goal will be to provide you with the skillset to program experiments and data analyses, as well as an understanding of how these tools are used to facilitate modern research. We will begin with the basics of how to develop algorithms and implement them with programming logic. In a series of hands-on projects, students will learn to program web-based interactive experiments and to analyze psychology and neuroscience datasets using JavaScript and R. Additional topics will include data management, version control, strategies for code debugging, data visualization, and an introduction to machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This course is ideal for students with little to no programming experience, although prior training in statistics is strongly recommended.\n\n\n\nPSYC4477 - Research Practicum in Cognitive Neuroscience\nThis course will provide an introduction to experimental methods used to understand how cognitive processes are implemented in the human brain. Topics will include research ethics, experimental design, appropriate use of statistical analysis, and methods for measuring and perturbing brain function. We will read and discuss research articles highlighting recent methodological advances and debates in psychology and neuroscience. In a series of hands-on projects, students will design and implement a cognitive neuroscience-motivated behavioral experiment, as well as interact with existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets.\n\n\n\nPSYC5573 - Advanced Topics in the Neuroscience of Memory\nWhen we remember a past event, we form a mental representation of its specific details, including the people, places, and time associated with the event. Understanding the nature of these memory representations is an important challenge for neuroscientists. This seminar will focus on theoretical and experimental approaches to characterizing memory representations in the brain, targeting questions such as: Where are memories stored? Can we identify and manipulate individual memory representations? How do memory representations change over time? And what aspects of memory are reactivated versus reconstructed? The course will integrate research from the cognitive and behavioral neurosciences, incorporating both human and rodent studies of memory. Class meetings will typically include student-led discussions of journal articles related to each week’s topic.\n\n\n\nPSYC5577 - The Hippocampus\nThe hippocampus has long been understood to play a critical role in long-term memory. However, its function appears to extend beyond processes typically associated with memory, and recent evidence has highlighted the structural and functional heterogeneity of the hippocampus. This seminar will focus on the theme of a multi-faceted hippocampus– one that is heterogeneous in its subregions, contributions to cognition, and connections with the rest of the brain. The course will integrate research from the cognitive and behavioral neurosciences, incorporating both human and rodent studies of hippocampal function. Class meetings will typically include student-led discussions of journal articles related to each week’s topic."

    "text": "Our research is broadly focused on understanding how episodic memories are represented and maintained by cortico-hippocampal networks, and how these memories can be shaped by modulatory factors such as emotional arousal. Right now, our main projects are centered on the network interactions supporting episodic construction, individual differences in episodic memory, and the role of memory processes in emotion regulation. This work depends on a combination of cognitive neuroscience methods, including fMRI (multivariate pattern analysis, functional connectivity, etc.), EEG, eye-tracking, and behavioral modeling. We are just as interested in cognition as we are in the brain, and we find this balance in our approach to designing cognitive neuroscience experiments.\nIf you’re interested in any of these topics, or in other topics that dovetail with our existing lines of research, get in touch! In my role as a professor and lab director, I am committed to providing tailored mentorship experiences for trainees with different interests and from different backgrounds. Please note that I do NOT plan to review applications from prospective PhD students in fall 2024. All of our other positions are currently filled, but there may be openings in the future.

    "text": "Please note that I do NOT plan to review applications from prospective PhD students in Fall 2024. The following contains information from previous years, which might be generally useful for understanding the grad admissions process. I wish you the best of luck in your search!\n\nOn our website, you can find more information about our research and a list of our recent publications. If you are interested in any of these topics, or other topics that dovetail with our existing lines of research, I encourage you to consider our lab for your doctoral training. Please see the following Q&A for information about whether and how to apply.\nIs the MemoLab right for me?\nAs you put together your list of potential grad school labs, there are a lot of factors to consider– the scientific fit of the lab, the PI’s mentoring style, the reputation of the program and university, the geographic location, among others. To help determine whether our lab is a good scientific and mentoring fit for you, I recommend the following:\nFor scientific fit - Read a couple of our papers. Do you think they are interesting? Do new scientific questions or ideas come to mind as you read them? Would you be interested in answering those questions? Does the idea of working with large datasets and analysis techniques excite you? If you’ve answered yes to those questions, then our lab might be a good scientific fit for you.\nFor mentoring fit - Read through our lab manual, which outlines my expectations for trainees and for myself as a mentor. Do these expectations fit with what you are looking for? Does the vibe seem right to you? One of my main goals as a mentor is to foster a collegial, collaborative environment with appreciation for each individual’s talents, perspectives, and life circumstances. My mentoring approach is likely to differ somewhat from person to person. If you are invited to interview with our lab, I encourage you to talk with the other trainees and see what their experiences have been.\nHow do I apply?\nSpecific application instructions can be found here. Note that the application fee can be waived in some circumstances, and I encourage you to apply for a waiver if you can. The GRE will be optional for this year’s application cycle.\nOur department uses a traditional lab-based admissions process, in that each student applies to work with a particular professor in a particular lab. If you wish to work with me, then I will be the one who is primarily reviewing your application. You should be sure to list my name on your application. You can list other professors as well; however, this is not required. In some cases, a grad student can be co-mentored by two professors. If this is something that you’re interested in and if it makes sense for your research interests, you should include this in your application.\nYou are welcome to email me ahead of time to introduce yourself. I do not typically hold Zoom meetings with applicants until after I’ve reviewed applications (but if there are extenuating circumstances, let me know). If you choose to email me before submitting your application, please include your resume or CV and a paragraph about your research interests and why you want to apply to my lab (see section below). If it is obvious to me that it’s not a good research fit, I may tell you, and then it’s up to you whether you proceed with the application process.\nOnce I have reviewed the applications, I will contact a short list of applicants for Zoom interviews, probably before the end of the year. Then an even shorter list will be invited to interview on campus early in the spring semester.\nWhat will make my application stand out?\nWhen I review applications, I pay most attention to two things: 1) the research fit and 2) demonstration of critical and creative thinking. Both of these can be communicated through the personal statement, although the other pieces of the application provide supporting evidence (especially letters of recommendation or descriptions of previous academic or research experiences). For research fit, I want to be able to read your application and understand why you’re applying to my lab in particular. What are the questions that drive your curiosity? How do they intersect with our general research program? You do not need to already have research experience that is directly connected to our lab’s work, although most successful applicants will have some background in cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience. You also do not need to have a specific plan for what kinds of experiments you want to run. But you should be able to express interest in questions or topics that are one or two degrees more specific than “the neuroscience of memory.”\nYour personal statement can also be a place to showcase your critical or creative thinking skills. If you can relate a topic that you care about to existing scientific research, that’s a great sign. When you describe your past academic, research, or work experiences, don’t just list what you did and where– describe why you did something the way that you did and what you learned from the process. I want to hear about how you’ve persisted and why you’ve decided that cognitive neuroscience is the field for you. And again, more than anything, I want to get a feel for the ideas, techniques, and topics that spark your curiosity.\nWhat types of research projects are you planning for the future?\nRight now, our main projects are centered on the network interactions supporting memory for events (including memory for affective and social information), individual differences in episodic memory, and the impact of memory reactivation on later retrieval. I am not currently recruiting students for research on emotion regulation or stress effects on memory. Most of our work uses behavioral, fMRI, or eye-tracking methods, and we are in the early days of a study combining TMS with fMRI, so that’s another option for incoming students.\nAdditional Resources: - BC Psychology & Neuroscience Doctoral Program Information - BC Psychology & Neuroscience Application Mentorship Program - How Applying to Grad School Works"

My doctoral research examined the causal role of the left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in emotional episodic memory encoding in young adults, using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). In parallel, I investigated the neural correlates of lateral PFC engagement during emotional memory retrieval in both younger and older adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nI am eager to continue leveraging neuroscience methods—including rTMS and fMRI—to explore the contributions of other cortical regions, such as the angular gyrus, to episodic memory processes. I am particularly interested in integrating emotional processing into future research that examines the role of posterior brain regions in emotional episodic memory retrieval.\nOutside the lab, I enjoy long walks, good coffee, and spending time with my partner and our cats."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past couple of years, the MemoLab has been working a new line of research using eye tracking to measure memory reinstatement. This work has been spearheaded by recent PhD Dr. Paula Brooks, who just shared her first preprint using the method. We found that gaze reinstatement is linked to memory for both the item and background components of a scene, and that it’s similar for both emotionally negative and neutral memories - suggesting that the processes supporting gaze reinstatement are independent of those that prioritize emotional item information in memory.\nWe have also released a new preprint that digs deeper into what cognitive factors guide gaze reinstatement. This project was led by recent BC grads Tingwei (Jerry) Hu and Hae Young Yi, who completed the study as part of their senior honors thesis projects. I’m amazed at how much they learned and accomplished over the past year, and I’m excited to share their results with the world. In brief, they found that gaze reinstatement is guided by attention to visual details, and it appears to be less sensitive to their spatial configuration or the exact eye movements needed to sample them. These results will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying gaze reinstatement and the role it plays in memory retrieval."

    "text": "Visualize the setting you ate breakfast in this morning. You will likely find that you can picture objects that were around you, what color they were, where they sat, and how they were positioned. You might even be able to recall that, as you ate breakfast this morning, you listened to the sound of the dishwasher running. This ability to recall a plethora of details associated with a context is a key feature of episodic memory.\nOur memories can be broadly divided into two subgroups: those that last only up to a few minutes, including our sensory, short-term, and working memory, and those which can last days, months, years, and even a lifetime, which we refer to as our long-term memory. Within long-term memory, we can make further distinctions, including differentiating between memories that do not require conscious recall such as procedural memories (think about the last time you rode a bike: did you have to think about how to do it, or does it just seem to come naturally?) and memories that we conscious recall. We call the latter category declarative memories, which can also be separated into two subgroups: semantic and episodic memory. The former consists mainly of factual information, while episodic memory holds all of our specific personal experiences from a particular time or place.\nOur episodic memories, like those of our last meal, are rich in detail, but how do we accomplish this? What are the neural mechanisms underlying the binding of certain aspects of a scene to their context? Cooper et al. 2020 is a study that looks at regions of the brain that process different features of memory and asks whether there are areas that might be tied to feature binding, or the integration of details into one memory of an event. It might be hard to imagine how we could recreate detail-rich episodic memories in the lab that would allow us to effectively explore these topics. Researchers must be able to present participants with a scene that has multiple, distinct details which can be effectively recalled later in a memory test. In Cooper et al. 2020, participants start by viewing an item in a context that they are told to remember. The item has a unique color, background, and is paired with an audio track that is either negative or neutral. Later, participants will be asked to recall the three aspects of the scene. During recall, they are presented with greyscale versions of objects they saw again and asked to do three things: First, they rotate the panoramic background behind the object until they believe they have lined up the item to the position it was presented in. Second, they use a color wheel to manipulate the color of the grey object until they believe it matches the color it was during encoding. Finally, they identify whether the sound associated with the object was negative or neutral.\nIn this way, the study looked at three aspects of a memory that are combined together in one event: location (1), color (2), and sound (3).\nThere are brain regions that are associated with different scene features: object color is represented in the V4, or the visual cortex, in the inferior occipital lobe, while location is often found in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) in the inferior tempo-occipital cortex, and sound processing is associated with the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. Cooper et al. 2020 verified that brain activity in these areas is predictive of the ability to later recall the details they are associated with. However, the study goes beyond these areas and looks for regions of the brain that are active when participants are viewing a scene that are predictors of remembering not just one detail, but multiple details together. Cooper et al. 2020 is able to accomplish this by starting with the results of the memory test. The study asks what the difference in brain activity is between trials where participants remembered more than one detail correctly. Through this method of working backward, areas of the brain that are associated with feature binding, or the successful integration of multiple details of a memory, can be identified.\nThe region of the brain that Cooper et al. 2020 focuses on after running these analyses is the left hippocampus. As shown below, we can see that the activity in the left hippocampus was greater during trials where the participant would later successfully recall color and scene, scene and sound, and all three together. Interestingly, there is less activity in the left hippocampus in trials where participants only recalled color and sound, but not scene. This indicates that the left hippocampus may play a role in the binding of scene (or location) information to other details of a memory, including color and sounds. Another distinct feature of the left hippocampal activity that helped researchers to conclude it may be associated with feature binding was that occurred later in the encoding phase. Participants viewed the objects in their contexts for 6 seconds, which may not seem like a long time, but within that 6 seconds, there are many changes in brain activity. While earlier activity in this 6-second window is in areas that help the participants perceive features of an event, later activity, like that in the hippocampus, might be associated with integrating just viewed details together into one event. The data collected supported this hypothesis: activity in the hippocampus early in encoding is not a great predictor of the number of details recalled, but activity at the end of encoding is.\nSo now we know one of the regions that might help us to recall all the little details of our breakfast this morning: the color of the food, the sound of the dishwasher running, and where the plate sat on the table. While you were eating this morning not only was your brain taking in each feature of the scene and helping you make sense of what you were perceiving, but also binding features together so that you recall them as one event: breakfast. Going forward from Cooper et al. 2020, future studies might choose to look more closely at the timing of these different processes that occur to ensure that they are truly a product of separate encoding events and not regional differences in blood flow. We can be sure, though, that the process of making memories is a multifaceted one that relies on feature binding to create cohesive events."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’ve ever experienced a late night, caffeine-fueled study session cramming for an exam you’ve put off to the last minute, you may have faced the temptation to simply place your textbook under your pillow, sleep on it, and hope for the best (yes, this myth does indeed exist and you can find several Reddit threads on it!). There is no evidence supporting the claim that sleeping on a book will magically help you retain information, but studies have found it’s possible to improve memory consolidation using targeted memory reactivation (TMR). TMR is a technique where memories can be cued during sleep using a stimulus that was present when the memory was initially encoded. For example, smelling a book while reading a certain passage of text and then being presented with the same scent during sleep can reactivate the memory and allow it to be stored more effectively into long-term memory. This process could be explained by the system consolidation theory of memory (Born & Wilhelm, 2012): think of memories as first being encoded and stored in a neurological waystation, such as the hippocampus. They lie dormant there and patiently wait in line to be shipped off to their long-term residences in the brain. However, not every piece of information/memory you encode is worth storing in long term memory, so during sleep some items may be “lost” or forgotten. If the information lost is your best friend’s boyfriend’s roommate’s birthday, then it’s not a cause for concern, but if it’s an incredibly important definition to remember ahead of your psychology exam, you may be more inclined to hold onto this memory if you can. Here’s where targeted memory reactivation comes into play. Targeted memory reactivation helps bring specific memories to the front of this metaphorical line, effectively telling your brain, “Hey! This is important. I need to remember this!”, and thereby increasing their likelihood of being stored in long term memory. Whoo hoo! So… perhaps Reddit users are onto something here…\nActive system consolidation relies on getting an appropriate amount of sleep, specifically slow wave sleep, in order for memories to be consolidated. This is especially salient for students as their ability to learn new material depends in part on the quality of sleep they receive. A study by Cousins, Sasmita, and Chee at Duke-NUS Medical School (2018) found that sleep deprivation (sleeping 5 hours a night for 5 consecutive nights) prior to learning new material in 15 to 18-year-olds significantly worsened their scores on a memory retrieval task compared to those who had not been sleep deprived (those who slept 9 hours a night for 5 consecutive nights). However, if you’re someone who is chronically sleep deprived, TMR has been suggested to be a tool to help combat the negative effects of sleep deprivation on learning and memory by biasing which memories are more likely to be stored in long term memory (Gao et al., 2020).\nIt was over these concerns of how chronic sleep deprivation could negatively impact student education and performance that inspired researchers Gao, Fillmore, and Scullin at Baylor University (2020) to construct a study testing the effects of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) on memory and conceptual learning. This was a shift in focus from previous TMR studies that only tested people’s memory of word /object lists - a fine way to measure memory, but less applicable to the average student/individual who is not tested on strict memorization. Gao et al. also chose music as the TMR cue because of its popularity as a memorization and study tool amongst students.\nThey recruited 50 undergraduate students with no prior economics backgrounds and instructed them to work through a self-guided, virtual college-level microeconomics lecture. Half of the students listened to classical music (the experimental TMR condition) and half listened to white noise (the control condition) while working. They then slept overnight in the laboratory where experimenters replayed either classical music or white noise when they entered slow-wave sleep. Results from an exam taken the next morning found that students who had undergone TMR (the classical music condition) had a higher probability of passing the exam (57.89% of TMR participants vs. 22.73% of control participants). The TMR group also scored 18.58% higher than the white noise group on integrative knowledge-transfer questions that required participants to apply learned concepts in novel ways. This improvement was seen even more drastically in female participants than male participants - a significant finding given experimental data showing women are more negatively affected by sleep deprivation than men (Goldestein-Piekarski et al, 2018; Conklin, Yao, Richardson, 2018). Finally, EEG analyses found that TMR participants had higher levels of frontal theta activity during sleep than control participants, suggesting this difference in brain activity is a method by which TMR can exert its positive effects. These improvements in conceptual integration were not present when participants returned 9 months later to take a similar exam, but in the short-term, TMR using music effectively improved exam performance and the ability to integrate college-level educational concepts. Although more work has to be done to determine the degree to which TMR may help sleep-deprived individuals, it remains an exciting and promising tool to help people consolidate memories more efficiently.\nThis raises the question: why is music an effective TMR tool? What broader connections does it have to memory and learning? From personal experience, you may have found that listening to certain music actually inhibits concentration and learning. Perhaps you find a song that’s incredibly upbeat makes you want to dance more than it makes you want to read “The Great Gatsby.” Or perhaps you find that listening to Adele is not the right mood for completing calculus problem sets, but Mozart is your jam. Studies have shown listening to music has a positive cognitive influence, especially when it comes to memory. Melody Chan and Yvonne Han (2022) found in a neuroimaging meta-analysis that classical music, but not other kinds of music, activated the limbic network - a collection of brain structures which has been implicated in mediating behavioral and emotional responses as well as learning and memory functions. However, other research has suggested it’s not necessarily the music itself that increases memory performance, but the effect music has on arousal and emotion, which in turn affects memory. Researchers Bottiroli, Russo, Vecchi, and Cavallini (2014) found that listening to classical music while performing various memory tasks improved overall performance. More specifically, listening to happy music led to increased brain processing speed. This suggests that listening to background music improves memory task performance by producing emotional states in the participants that activate the limbic system.\nApart from illustrating how associations between a stimulus, such as music, and memories can lead to more effective memory consolidation during slow wave sleep stimulus presentation, the experiment by Gao et al. highlights the wider applicability of TMR outside the laboratory. More generally, it demonstrates how scientific findings can be utilized outside academia to improve people’s daily lives - if listening to music while studying and sleeping is something you regularly do, you can take advantage of TMR to learn more efficiently, even if you don’t get the recommended amount of sleep.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Episodic memory is a type of long-term memory that involves the recollection of specific events, experiences, and personal happenings that occurred at a particular time and place. What makes a memory episodic is characterized by several key features:\n\nTemporal Context: Episodic memories are associated with a specific time and date. When recalling episodic memories, you can typically pinpoint when the event occurred, such as a birthday party on a specific date.\nSpatial Context: Episodic memories are linked to a particular location or setting. You can remember where the event took place, which adds to the vividness of the memory.\nSubjective Experience: Episodic memories include your personal experience and perspective. They often involve your thoughts, emotions, and sensory perceptions at the time of the event. For example, you might remember how you felt, what you saw, or what you heard during a significant event.\nMultisensory Information: Episodic memories may involve multiple sensory details, including visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory sensations. These sensory elements contribute to the richness of the memory.\nAutonoetic Consciousness: Episodic memories are accompanied by a sense of “mental time travel” or autonoetic consciousness. This means that when you recall an episodic memory, you are aware that you are mentally reliving a past experience, and you have a sense of self within that memory.\n\nOverall, episodic memory allows you to mentally relive past experiences and is crucial for constructing your sense of self and personal identity. It plays a significant role in your ability to remember specific events, which can be important for learning, problem-solving, and decision-making in your daily life."

    "text": "In the Memory Modulation Lab, we use the tools of cognitive neuroscience to answer questions about memory and the brain.\nBy establishing the basic mechanisms supporting human memory, our research helps to provide a foundation for:\n\nidentifying ways to improve learning and memory in day-to-day life.\nrevealing what might be going on when our memory systems break down (e.g., in neurodegenerative disorders).\nunderstanding why our memories sometimes seem to work against us (e.g., in anxiety and mood disorders).\n\nThis research would not be possible without grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation, and Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.\n\nLab approach\nOur research incorporates multiple techniques for understanding cognitive and brain function, including functional neuroimaging, non-invasive brain stimulation, behavioral modeling, and eye-tracking. This combination of techniques allows us to characterize both the brain network interactions and cognitive processes involved in reconstructing episodic memories.\n\n\n\nHow does the brain store and remember the details of past events?\nMemories are selective. Some events are remembered vividly while others are largely forgotten. Even within a particular memory, some event details may be remembered faithfully while others are lost. One of the aims of our research is to understand the cognitive and brain mechanisms that lead to variability in the quality of memory. We want to be able to predict not only whether someone will remember an event, but what they will remember about it and how that will influence their subjective experience of memory. To achieve this goal, we combine novel experimental designs with advanced techniques for understanding cognitive and brain function, including functional neuroimaging, eye-tracking, computational modeling, and non-invasive brain stimulation. In particular, we have been optimizing methods for reading out the quality of one’s memory, and then using this information to develop predictive models linking memory features to patterns of brain activity.\n\n\nHow do functional brain networks interact to support episodic memory?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor several decades, research on the neural basis of memory has focused on the medial temporal lobes (MTL), including the hippocampus and its surrounding cortical areas. It is now increasingly apparent, however, that functional differences among MTL regions are related to their participation in distinct cortical networks that are themselves dissociable across multiple cognitive domains. Based on these observations, we have argued that memory function can be best understood as arising from distinct yet interacting cortico-hippocampal systems: an anterior temporal system that supports representations of items and their significance, and a posterior medial system that supports their integration into a contextual framework. As these two networks interact to contribute different aspects of episodic memory, adopting this network perspective may improve our understanding of the complexity of episodic memory as well as its ability to be flexibly modulated. In our lab, we use functional neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation to characterize the network interactions that support the integration and reconstruction of complex events.\n\n\nHow does emotion interact with memory processes?\nEmotional events tend to be remembered more vividly than neutral events, but not all event details benefit from the enhancing influence of emotion on memory. A goal of our research is to understand how emotion acts to enhance, filter, and reshape memories through its impact on medial temporal lobe function. We have found evidence for the idea that there are dissociable pathways supporting episodic memory for emotional and contextual information, suggesting that emotion might bias memory networks to favor some types of memory representations over others. Recently, we have started to look at emotion-memory interactions from a new perspective, investigating the role of memory processes in mediating cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation technique. We want to know whether and how memory reconstruction processes can be leveraged to make emotional memories feel better."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Studying episodic memory in a laboratory setting involves the use of controlled experiments and various techniques to understand how individuals encode, store, and retrieve specific events and personal experiences. Here are some common methods and techniques used to study episodic memory in the lab:\nRecall and Recognition Tasks: Researchers often use recall and recognition tasks to assess episodic memory. In recall tasks, participants are asked to remember and describe specific details about a previously presented event or story. In recognition tasks, participants are presented with a set of items or events, some of which they have seen before, and they must identify which ones they remember. These tasks help measure the accuracy and completeness of memory retrieval.\nNeuroimaging: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans can be used to observe brain activity during memory tasks. These scans can help researchers identify the brain regions and networks involved in encoding, storing, and retrieving episodic memories.\nElectrophysiological Measures: Electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) can provide real-time information about brain activity associated with memory processes, including encoding and retrieval.\nEye Tracking: Eye-tracking technology can be used to monitor participants’ eye movements while they view stimuli related to episodic memories. It can provide insights into attentional processes and what aspects of stimuli are most salient during encoding and retrieval.\nExperimental Manipulations: Researchers can manipulate various factors such as the type of encoding strategy, the spacing of learning trials, the emotional content of memories, and the presence of distractions to investigate how these variables impact episodic memory performance.\nBy employing these methods and techniques, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes and neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory and its various facets, including encoding, storage, consolidation, and retrieval. These studies contribute to our knowledge of memory function and can have practical implications in fields such as education, psychology, and neuroscience."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever done something embarrassing and find yourself relieving that moment for days afterwards? You’re not alone, negative and embarrassing memories can be intrusive and persistent, interrupting our everyday thoughts. Our episodic memory is our collective recollection for prior everyday events and experiences. Emotional episodic memories have become an area of interest because of the strong responses that they can evoke upon recall. Triggering an unpleasant memory can lead to unwanted stress or anxiety, warranting a response that attempts to control these feelings. This concept has immense clinical implications and has been observed in psychology practices for decades. In severe and recurring forms, it can be diagnosed as PTSD or another anxiety disorder. As discussed above, smaller scale embarrassing moments can have a similar effect. Research has been focused on how to introduce modifications that will reduce the emotionality associated with a specific episodic memory (Samide & Ritchey, 2020).\nOne mechanism for studying memory modifications includes testing conditioned fear memories. Conditioned fear memories come from associating an unpleasant stimulus with a neutral stimulus so that subsequent presentation of the neutral stimulus leads to a fear response. Research has indicated that one of the best methods for reducing these learned fear responses is through reactivation and extinction methods. Extinction is the process of presenting the neutral stimulus without the unpleasant one and has been effective in reducing fear response that had previously been learned. While these fear memories have less features compared to our day-to-day episodic memories, they provide foundational information on techniques for reducing memory emotionality.\nGiven the research findings on conditioned fear memories, one key area of study in episodic memory modification research has been retrospective reappraisal. This involves reactivating a memory and subsequently using reconstructive processes to reduce the negative impact of the memory. Memory reactivation can involve using cues to bring a specific memory to mind. This is the first step in effective memory modifications because it is thought to “re-open” the memory for editing. If a memory is reactivated, new information can be introduced, at which point research suggests that this new information is incorporated into the memory, making it less emotional than before. Oftentimes, thinking of the memory more positively or finding the silver lining can be just as effective as introducing new information. This technique is promising as it provides a way to introduce information to a memory that would ultimately make it less emotional. The next time the memory is retrieved, it will include the updated or positive information with it.\nThe retrospective reappraisal model has shown what techniques can be useful in reducing emotional responses for a memory. Research has also found that suppressing these emotional responses (also known as memory suppression) can make bad feelings feel worse for many individuals. This suggests that suppressing a negative emotional response to a memory can actually lead to more intrusive recollections of that memory. Memory suppression avoids activation of any specific details and only has partial reactivation of the memory. This is in huge contrast to retrospective reappraisal which reactivates the entire memory and all of the specific details associated with it. One hypothesis for the difference in results of these memory modification techniques is that strong reactivation for memory details leads to reduction in emotionality and promotes adaptive learning techniques in comparison to memory suppression.\nWhile this is a new area of research, initial results suggest that retrospective reappraisal is a productive way to change the emotionality associated with a particular memory. Given the clinical applications, more work will need to be done to understand the specific long-term effects of retrospective reappraisal to determine if this technique could prove useful in reducing negative emotional responses for significant periods of time. In comparison to memory suppression, retrospective reappraisal appears to be a more promising technique for emotional memory modification. Initial results do suggest long-term changes in negative emotionality of episodic memories, which provides a positive outlook towards retrospective reappraisal as a useful memory modification technique."

    "text": "We have recently made the leap to using the BIDS apps mriqc and fmriprep for fMRI quality control and pre-processing, respectively.\nThe instructions for installation and usage can be found in the documentation, but in some cases, I had to cobble together information from different sources. So here’s a run-down of how to run fmriprep on the Boston College Linux cluster (Sirius). If you’re not at BC, you might still find the instructions useful for setting everything up on your own cluster. The instructions are nearly identical for mriqc– I’ll note some differences at the end.\n\nHow to run FMRIPREP\n\nInstall Docker on your local computer. If you want to test out the apps on your local machine before using them on the cluster, increase the default memory settings (Preferences &gt; Advanced).\nUse Docker to pull the most recent version of fmriprep: docker pull poldracklab/fmriprep:latest\nCreate a singularity image of the Docker container. This is assuming that you cannot run Docker directly on your cluster, which is the case for us. Instructions here. This will take some time. It’s a big file.\nCopy the singularity image to a folder on the cluster. Make sure singularity is installed on your cluster. Research Services already installed it on the BC cluster (Sirius).\nGet a FreeSurfer license file and save it somewhere in your directory. If you want to include FreeSurfer processing, you’ll need to point fmriprep to this file.\nMake sure your dataset follows BIDS format using the helpful BIDS validator tool.\nYou’re ready to run! Let’s start by running it on an interactive node. The following command will run fmriprep for a single participant (sub-s001) on 8 processors, which speeds it up a lot (--nthreads 8). It skips the FreeSurfer recon-all step because it’s rather time-consuming (--fs-no-reconall), although I’ve left in the license file path (--fs-license-file). It will save out the functional data in T1w (native) space and template (MNI) space (--output-space). In the Terminal, enter the following:\nqsub -I -X -l walltime=24:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=8,mem=30gb\nWait until the compute node opens, then:\nmodule load singularity\nsingularity run /data/ritcheym/singularity/poldracklab_fmriprep_latest-2018-01-04-866557a8f305.img /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/sourcedata/ /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/derivs/ participant --participant-label s001 -w /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/work/ --nthreads 8 --fs-license-file ~/freesurfer/license.txt --fs-no-reconall --output-space {T1w,template}\nCheck out the output, which should be saved in derivs/fmriprep (or whatever path you specified above).\n\nIsn’t it pretty? Make sure it did everything you expected it to do before you move forward with running the entire batch of participants. For instance, it will skip slice time correction if you don’t have SliceTiming in the json file describing your functional data.\nIt will also skip field map-based correction if you don’t have the appropriate info in your fmap json files. One note about that: you must include the IntendedFor parameter to tell it which functional runs correspond to the field map.\n\nNow you’re ready to run it as a job array, which will let you simultaneously process a batch of participants. Create a pbs file so that it looks something like this:\n#!/bin/tcsh\n#PBS -l mem=30gb,nodes=1:ppn=8,walltime=24:00:00\n#PBS -m abe -M ritcheym@bc.edu\n#PBS -N orbit_fmriprep_1-6\n#PBS -t 1-6\n\nmodule load singularity\nsingularity run /data/ritcheym/singularity/poldracklab_fmriprep_latest-2018-01-04-866557a8f305.img /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/sourcedata/ /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/derivs/ participant --participant-label s00${PBS_ARRAYID} -w /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/work/ --nthreads 8 --fs-license-file ~/freesurfer/license.txt --fs-no-reconall --output-space {T1w,template}\nIn the Terminal, navigate to the directory where you’ve saved your pbs file and call: qsub fmriprep_job.pbs (or whatever you’ve named it).\nYou’re done! Now check your data.\n\n\n\nAdjustments for MRIQC\nRunning mriqc is very similar. Follow all of the steps ahead, with 2 exceptions: 1) You do not need the FreeSurfer license file, and 2) The command should look something like this:\nsingularity run /data/ritcheym/singularity/poldracklab_mriqc_latest-2018-01-18-9c5425cc1abb.img /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/sourcedata/ /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/derivs/mriqc/ participant --participant-label s001 -w /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/work/mriqc/ --n_procs 8\nBy the way, I’m not sure why fmriprep seems to want the --nthreads flag and mriqc wants to the --n_procs flag. The online documentation gives you multiple options for both, but I got a bug when using the other options in my job array.\nAfter you’ve run mriqc for multiple subjects, you can generate a group report by running:\nsingularity run /data/ritcheym/singularity/poldracklab_mriqc_latest-2018-01-18-9c5425cc1abb.img /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/sourcedata/ /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/derivs/mriqc/ group -w /data/ritcheym/data/fmri/orbit/data/work/mriqc/\nThis runs super quickly (like, 2 seconds).\nA final note: We’ve been running into permissions issues with running singularity on files owned by another user (even when we have read/write access). We don’t have a solution other than making sure the owner is the one who actually sets up the job arrays. If anyone knows the answer, please share."

    "text": "Interested in learning more about research? We are recruiting participants (ages 18-35) for a variety of studies going on in our lab.\nSome studies use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study how the human brain supports different cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. These studies usually last about 2-3 hours and take place at the Harvard Center for Brain Science (http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) in Cambridge, MA.\nOther studies use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the relationship between brain waves and cognition. These studies usually last about 2-3 hours and take place within our lab at Boston College.\nIf you are interested in learning more about our research studies, or if you want to discuss whether you’re eligible to participate, please contact us via email (memolabstudy@bc.edu). Thanks for your interest!"

    "text": "Undergraduate research assistants (RAs) are a crucial part of any psychology lab. Working as a RA is a great opportunity to learn more about psychology and neuroscience and to develop both the “soft skills” and technical skills that are useful for any STEM profession. RAs will have the opportunity to learn more about research methods and current directions in cognitive neuroscience, as well as the programming and data analysis skills that complement our experimental work. This can be valuable training for students interested in pursuing graduate school in any field, including (but not limited to) cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. For students with existing skills in computer science, our lab can also offer unique opportunities to develop tools for cognitive neuroscience research. Because our lab is relatively small, we are able to provide tailored mentorship experiences for students with different interests and from different backgrounds.\nThere are a few different ways in which undergraduates can get involved in our lab. One way is to be hired as a RA in our lab, typically for 4-8 hours per week. We have a limited number of total hours available each semester, so these positions tend to be competitive. Another way is to earn course credit through the Undergraduate Research course. Students enrolled in this course work as an RA for approximately 10 hours per week and also complete readings and a few short written assignments. Students must apply for these positions in the same way that they apply for paid positions. Students who have spent at least one semester in lab may be eligible to apply for a paid undergraduate research fellowship, which involves a more significant time and scholarly commitment to lab. Note that all of our paid options can be applied to the work-study program.\nStudents who are interested in doing a senior thesis project in our lab are encouraged to reach out directly to me (Prof. Ritchey) no later than early spring of your junior year, in addition to filling out the application linked below.\nAt the end of each semester, we interview for any openings that we have for the following semester. A one-year commitment is required, and positions are very limited. If you are interested in joining us, please submit an application (BC ID required).\nIf you are not able to get involved as a research assistant at this time, but are interested in learning more about cognitive neuroscience or memory, I encourage you to check out the courses I offer at Boston College. I also maintain a list of summer and post-baccalaureate research opportunities that allow you to get paid for doing psychology and neuroscience research."
