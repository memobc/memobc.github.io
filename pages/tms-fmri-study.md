We are recruiting participants (ages 18-35) for a study of the brain processes supporting cognition, including our ability to learn and remember. The study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and it involves three 1-3 hour testing sessions. Sessions will take place at the [Harvard Center for Brain Science](http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) in Cambridge, MA.

In order to participate, you must not have a history of neurological disorders (e.g., concussions, epilepsy) or a history of psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, attention deficit disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress).

If you are interested in learning more about the study, or if you want to discuss whether youâ€™re eligible to participate, please contact us via email (memolabstudy\@bc.edu). Thanks for your interest!
