Interested in learning more about research? We are recruiting participants (ages 18-35) for a variety of studies going on in our lab.

Some studies use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study how the human brain supports different cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. These studies usually last about 2-3 hours and take place at the Harvard Center for Brain Science (http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) in Cambridge, MA.

Other studies use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the relationship between brain waves and cognition. These studies usually last about 2-3 hours and take place within our lab at Boston College.

If you are interested in learning more about our research studies, or if you want to discuss whether youâ€™re eligible to participate, please contact us via email (memolabstudy\@bc.edu). Thanks for your interest!
